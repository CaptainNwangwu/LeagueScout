## Base User Stories

- As a user, I would like to input a riot name and get their current champ pool
- As a user, I want to see a list of champions that the player has played in their last 20 games
- As I user I want the champions to be ranked by performance, frequency, and mastery score

## Coach Stories

- As a coach, I want to know what champions a player is performing best on.
- As a coach, I would like to see a summary of the player's history in amatuer leagues
- As a coach, I would like to be able to provide an entire team OPGG and have the scouting work
  as opposed to having to manually enter each player's name.
- As a coach, I would like to add the leagues that a player is currently playing in (as a search/dropdown)
  to be able to view their champion pool history in the leagues (Aegis' system is a tier 1 example of this)
- As a coach, I would like to be able to look up a team for a certain leauge, and have a list of their previous drafts via draftlol provided. (Some leagues will not make this data as easily accessible, so provide the option
  to enter it manually)
